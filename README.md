**Tempo** is a local-first, AI-powered productivity app that transforms your daily task dump into optimized, focused work sessions using Pomodoro-inspired timeboxing. Designed for knowledge workers, students, and anyone who wants to plan smarter, Tempo helps you prioritize, schedule, and complete your most important work‚Äîone session at a time. Tempo leverages micro AI throughout the app for fast, contextual, and privacy-respecting task management.
