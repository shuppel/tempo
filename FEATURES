#FEATURE BOARD

## TO DO
-Test the Frog's feature and count (use 3.7 high reasoning)
- hrs and minutes (instead of total minutes)
- Progress Modal (with different process illustration)
- DayLoadWorkManager Service:
  * New service between Process Tasks and Create-Session
  * Handles tasks that don't fit in user's day schedule
  * Features:
    - User-defined start/end times for workday
    - Automatic task overflow handling
    - Scheduling optimization across multiple days
    - Preserves task relationships when rescheduling
    - Prioritizes important tasks (frogs) in current day
    - Respects energy curves throughout the day 

## COMPLETED
- Story Mapping & Task Reference System:
  * Robust tracking of original story/task titles during splitting
  * Multiple matching strategies for finding stories (exact, base title, fuzzy)
  * Mapping data passed to API for improved reference resolution
  * Fixes "Story not found in original stories" errors
  * Maintains relationship between original and split tasks 


  ## THINKING...
  think about types.ts : types, categories
  also down stream: badges, projects
  What would be nice, is being able to create reports and summaries from what you've been doing. Feed your debriefs, reports for your own progress to yourself. Have your own AI help you understand your own progress.

## BUGS 03/21/2025
[ ] The focus cards for some reason are adding time to the elapsed time and unable to solve using claude/cursor(not getting it)
[ ]The ghost text on the front page is now not seperate lines. We should be on seperate lines.
[ ]The work blocks div that is all white needs to be dark (in dark mode) 
[ ]Need to be able to edit the work blocks (click and edit, very simple)
[ ]Rate limits, hardening prior to production. 
[ ]Env file with passkey (create a pin to submit)

## BUGS 04/07 
[x]When you exit the debrief modal, the modal will come up as "Complete" modal (when it should just save modal information and say "continue" modal)
[ ]we still need to test if the modal will go all the way to the end (send data)
[x] Need to analyze all the data we have.
[ ] can the session debrief have a key or id associatred with the session itself?
[ ] can we add some versioning things as well and change log? are you able to look at all commits in the entirety/history of this code repo?

## BUGS 04.08
[ ] we need to push to dev, fix all the lint errors, so we can get this setup. We need to also have a limit call on the API. This we can do using Vercel KV and Upstash Ratelimit
[ ] we need a sync engine (replicache is strong, maybe expensive option long term)
