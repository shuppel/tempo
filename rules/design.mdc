# It Sucks, Make it Pop!
Our philosophy is simple: *It Sucks, Make it Pop!* When a design isn't working, we transform it with best-in-class solutions that elevate user experience.

Below is the design rubric for assessing and refreshing our interfaces:

| **Design Element**       | **F** | **D** | **C** | **B** | **A** |
|--------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Color Palette**        | Colors are incoherent and clashing; contrast is poor, completely failing to support readability or brand identity. | Poor color choices with significant contrast issues; colors appear uncoordinated and disjointed from the brand. | A basic, functional palette that meets minimum standards but lacks intentionality and depth. | A thoughtful, well-coordinated palette that supports brand identity; minor contrast or variety issues may be present. | Exceptional and innovative use of color that enhances user experience, perfectly reflects the brand, and meets all accessibility guidelines. |
| **Layout & Grid**        | Layout is chaotic and lacks any structure or grid, resulting in a disorganized interface. | Weak structure with an inconsistent or poorly applied grid; elements seem randomly placed and confusing. | An adequate layout that uses a basic grid system; content is organized, though misalignments or inconsistencies are evident. | A well-structured layout with a clear grid system that logically organizes content; only minor deviations exist. | Masterful use of layout and grid, creating flawless organization and balance that significantly enhances usability and aesthetics. |
| **Typography**           | Typography is haphazard with mismatched fonts; legibility is compromised and no clear hierarchy exists. | Inconsistent type choices undermine readability and fail to establish a clear hierarchy, leaving the design unpolished. | Functional typography that is legible with a basic hierarchy, yet lacks nuance or consistent style. | Strong typography with clear hierarchy and well-chosen typefaces that enhance readability and support the brand identity. | Exceptional typography that is both innovative and timeless, offering a compelling hierarchy and impeccable legibility. |
| **Hierarchy & Navigation** | No clear visual hierarchy; navigation is confusing or missing, leaving users overwhelmed and lost. | Weak hierarchy with an unclear navigation structure that forces users to struggle to find essential information. | A basic hierarchy that makes navigation serviceable, though it may not optimally guide users through the content. | A clear and intuitive hierarchy paired with well-organized navigation that enables users to quickly locate key elements. | Superior hierarchy and navigation that intuitively guide users, anticipate needs, and deliver a seamless, engaging journey. |
| **Accessibility**        | The design completely disregards accessibility standards, making it unusable for users with disabilities. | Minimal accessibility considerations result in significant barriers; many standards are unmet. | Meets basic accessibility standards, ensuring usability for most users but lacking in comprehensive features. | Proactive accessibility measures are in place with most guidelines met; only minor issues remain. | Exemplary adherence to accessibility guidelines, employing inclusive design practices that ensure full usability for all users. |
| **Redundancy**           | Redundancy is either excessive—leading to clutter—or completely missing, causing confusion and miscommunication. | Poorly managed repetition results in either too little reinforcement of key elements or an overwhelming duplication that hinders clarity. | Some intentional redundancy exists, but its application is inconsistent, leaving the design feeling unbalanced. | Thoughtful redundancy reinforces important elements effectively without overwhelming the interface. | Optimal use of redundancy, with strategic repetition that creates familiarity, reinforces key messages, and guides user behavior seamlessly. |
| **Spacing & Alignment**  | Spacing and alignment are severely off; elements are randomly placed, creating visual disarray and impairing readability. | Inconsistent spacing and poor alignment contribute to a disjointed appearance that detracts from the overall design. | Basic spacing and alignment are maintained, making the design functional, though it lacks refinement and precision. | Consistent and well-considered spacing and alignment yield a balanced and visually pleasing layout with only minor issues. | Flawless spacing and alignment enhance visual rhythm and harmony, elevating the design to a professional, polished level. |
