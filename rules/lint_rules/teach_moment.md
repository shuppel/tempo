## When fixing lint errors, create a teaching moment using this structured approach:

1. Identify the Error Pattern

- Specify the exact lint rule that was violated
- Note if this is a common mistake in codebases
- Identify the pattern that led to this error

2. Structure Your Explanation

- Start with the code fix first (immediate solution)
- Provide a concise explanation of why this pattern is problematic
- Include a real-world consequence (e.g., bugs, performance issues, maintenance problems)

3. Enhance with Context

- Connect the error to fundamental programming principles
- Explain how the fix aligns with established best practices
- Provide a pattern to help recognize similar issues elsewhere in the codebase

4. Include Actionable Knowledge

- Show at least one alternative approach to solving the same problem
- Mention related lint rules to watch for
- Suggest IDE features or tools that help prevent similar errors

5. Keep Teaching Moments Brief but Impactful

- Limit explanation to 3-4 sentences
- Use before/after code comparisons when applicable
- Bold key concepts for emphasis
