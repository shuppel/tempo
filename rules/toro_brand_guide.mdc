/* =========================================
   TORO APP - DESIGN GUIDELINES
   ========================================= */

/** 1. Brand Identity **/
Brand Name: Toro
Description: A playful, retro-inspired app that merges classic 8–16 pixel art aesthetics with modern design functionality.  
Core Values: Fun, Nostalgia, Simplicity, Approachability  

/* =========================
   2. Color Palette
   ========================= */
/*
Use a vibrant yet balanced palette reminiscent of classic 8–16 bit games.
You can incorporate the NES color palettes or the custom "NES Elements" palette 
for maximum retro authenticity. Example references:
- nes_palette_references.mdc
- nes_elements_color_pallette.mdc
*/

/* =========================
   3. Typography
   ========================= */
/*
Below are recommended fonts, inspired by the screenshot references 
(e.g., "Text Me One," "Happy Monkey," "Nunito Sans" or similar). 
These can be swapped with pixel fonts if a more explicitly retro look is desired.
*/
Primary Font (Headings): "Text Me One"
- Usage: Headlines, key branding text
- Recommended Sizes: 16px, 24px, 32px (pixel multiples to keep a crisp look)

Secondary Font (Subheadings / Accents): "Happy Monkey"
- Usage: Subheadings, playful accent text
- Recommended Sizes: 12px, 16px

Body Font (Paragraphs / UI): "Nunito Sans"
- Usage: General text, descriptions, instructions
- Recommended Sizes: 8px, 10px, 12px, 14px
- Note: Keep within the 8–16 pixel range for a retro vibe

/* =========================
   4. Layout & Grid
   ========================= */
/*
For a pixel-art-inspired interface, adopt a grid-based approach:
*/
- Base Grid Unit: 8px
- Spacing & Padding: Multiples of 8px (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px)
- Icon & Sprite Sizes: Stick to 16x16 or 32x32 px for consistency
- Alignment: Snap elements to the grid to preserve the crisp, retro feel

/* =========================
   5. Iconography & Illustrations
   ========================= */
- Pixel Art Style: Emphasize blocky, clearly defined shapes with limited colors
- Consistent Stroke Weight: Use 1–2 px outlines where needed
- Limited Palette: Reuse colors from the main palette to unify the overall look
- Animation Frames: Keep sprite animations minimal (2–4 frames) for a vintage game effect

/* =========================
   6. UI Components
   ========================= */
- Buttons: Use solid blocks of color with simple pixel borders. Hover/active states can shift one or two tones darker/lighter.
- Toggles & Checkboxes: 8px or 16px icons, consistent with the pixel grid
- Navigation Bars: Minimalistic, with strong color contrast. Consider using pixel patterns or thin lines to differentiate sections.
- Forms & Inputs: Maintain a small, pixel-based border (1–2 px). Text inside should align to the 8px grid.

/* =========================
   7. Imagery & Illustration
   ========================= */
- Retro Motifs: Stars, pixel fire, coin icons, or game-inspired shapes
- Backgrounds: Simple, patterned, or gradient transitions using a small set of colors
- Branding Imagery: Combine “Toro” name or logo with pixel-art bull imagery if desired

/* =========================
   8. Tone & Voice
   ========================= */
- Fun & Approachable: Write in a friendly, concise manner
- Nostalgic & Retro: Use references to classic gaming when appropriate, but keep the copy easy to read and modern in tone

/* =========================
   9. Additional Notes
   ========================= */
- File Formats: For crispness, use PNG or SVG for pixel elements; avoid excessive scaling that may blur pixels.
- Accessibility: Ensure enough contrast between text and backgrounds.  
- Testing: Always test at 1x (100% zoom) to confirm pixel-perfect alignment.
