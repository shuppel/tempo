# Toro Task Pomodoro - Supabase Migration Progress

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ **Database Schema Creation**: Created SQL schema file for Supabase.
2. ✅ **TypeScript Type Definitions**: Added database types for type safety.
3. ✅ **Supabase Client Configuration**: Set up the Supabase client instance.
4. ✅ **Authentication Components**: 
   - Created `AuthForm.tsx` for user login/signup
   - Created `AuthGuard.tsx` to protect routes
   - Set up auth callback routes
   - Added form validation with Zod
   - Implemented password reset functionality
   - Created logout route handler
   - Added SignOutButton component
5. ✅ **Middleware Configuration**: Added middleware for session management and route protection.
6. ✅ **Storage Service Migration**: Created `supabaseStorage.ts` implementation.
7. ✅ **Session Storage Service Update**: Updated `SessionStorageService` to use `supabaseStorage`.
8. ✅ **Data Migration Tool**: Created utility for migrating data from localStorage to Supabase.
9. ✅ **Migration Page**: Added `/migrate` page for users to migrate their data.
10. ✅ **Package Dependencies**: Installed required Supabase packages.

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing**:
   - Test authentication flows (login, signup, password reset)
   - Test session CRUD operations with Supabase
   - Test data migration tool
   - Test protected routes

2. **Route Protection**: 
   - Ensure all session-related routes are protected by AuthGuard
   - ✅ Update the middleware to redirect unauthenticated users

3. **Deployment**:
   - Update environment variables in production
   - Ensure proper Supabase project configuration in production

## How to Test the Migration

1. **Authentication**:
   - Visit `/auth/login` to create an account or sign in
   - Try password reset functionality using the "Forgot password?" link
   - Test the signup flow at `/auth/signup`
   - Verify that protected routes redirect to login
   - Test the logout functionality

2. **Data Operations**:
   - Create, read, update and delete sessions
   - Verify that data persists after page reload
   - Check that changes are reflected in Supabase tables

3. **Data Migration**:
   - Visit `/migrate` to test the migration tool
   - Verify that existing localStorage data is properly migrated to Supabase
   - Check that sessions remain accessible after migration

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly with the new Supabase backend.
2. Add route protection to all session-related pages.
3. Deploy the updated application to production.
4. Monitor for any issues during the transition period.
5. Consider adding additional Supabase features like real-time updates.

## Benefits of Migration

- **Cross-device sync**: Users can access their data from multiple devices
- **Data persistence**: Data remains safe even if browser storage is cleared
- **User accounts**: Users can now register and log in to secure their data
- **Scalability**: Supabase provides a robust backend that can scale with the application
- **Advanced features**: Future implementation of collaborative features is now possible
